This repository is my final group project for my CIS36B - Intermediate Problem Solving in Java at De Anza College, Spring quarter 2020.
The link for project requirements is attached here  [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20191201035000/http://deanzacollegecis.jenniferparrish.net/home/cis36b/cis-36b-schedule/courseproject).
This is my first group project since I learned to program. I was assigned to a group of 4, our group has the first time learning about java WebSocket after browsing the internet. We also have 3 weeks to work as a team and learn how to collaborate with each other.
